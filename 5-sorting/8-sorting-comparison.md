# Comparison of Basic Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort works well when data is almost sorted already.
- Selection Sort is better than Bubble Sort in cases where we need to minimize the number of swaps to be made.
- Insertion Sort works well as online/live sorting algorithm, where data is coming in and being sorted simultaneously in real time.
- Worst case time complexity for all three is O(n^2).
- Best case (almost sorted data) time complexity for Bubble and Insertion Sort is O(n), while for Selection Sort is still O(n^2).

- Merge and Quick Sort are much better, however, Bubble, Insertion and Selection may perform better for small datasets.
